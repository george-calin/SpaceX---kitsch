	<h1>FALCON 9</h1>
		<div class="container">
			<div class="box">
			<p>Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the 
			reliable and safe transport of satellites and the Dragon spacecraft into orbit. 
			Falcon 9 is the first orbital class rocket capable of reflight. SpaceX believes rocket 
			reusability is the key breakthrough needed to reduce the cost of access to space and enable 
			people to live on other planets.
			<br><br>
			Falcon 9 was designed from the ground up for maximum reliability. Falcon 9’s simple two-stage configuration minimizes the number of separation events -- and with nine first-stage engines, it can safely complete its mission even in the event of an engine shutdown.
			</p>

			<p>
			Falcon 9 made history in 2012 when it delivered Dragon into the correct orbit for rendezvous 
			with the International Space Station, making SpaceX the first commercial company 
			ever to visit the station. Since then Falcon 9 has made numerous trips to space, 
			delivering satellites to orbit as well as delivering and returning cargo from the space 
			station for NASA. Falcon 9, along with the Dragon spacecraft, was designed from the outset 
			to deliver humans into space and under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is actively working 
			toward this goal.

			<h2>Payload</h2>
			<p>Falcon 9 delivers payloads to space aboard the Dragon spacecraft or inside a composite fairing.</p>
			<h3>Spacecraft</h3>
			<p>Dragon carries cargo in the spacecraft’s pressurized capsule and unpressurized trunk, 
			which can also accommodate secondary payloads. In the future, 
			Dragon will carry astronauts in the pressurized capsule as well.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Composite Fairing</h3>
			<p>The payload fairing is for the delivery of satelites to destination in low Earth orbit, geosynchronous transfer
			orbit and beyond</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h2>INTERSTAGE</h2>
			
			<p>The interstage is a composite structure that connects the first and second stages and holds the release and separation system. Falcon 9 uses an all-pneumatic stage separation system for low-shock, highly reliable separation that can be tested on
			the ground, unlike pyrotechnic 
			systems used on most launch vehicles.</p>
			<br><br><br><br>
			<h2>FIRST STAGE</h2>
			<p>Falcon 9’s first stage incorporates nine Merlin 
			engines and aluminum-lithium alloy tanks containing
			liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellant. 
			After ignition, a hold-before-release system ensures that 
			all engines are verified for full-thrust performance 
			before the rocket is released for flight. Then, with
			thrust greater than five 747s at full power, the Merlin 
			engines launch the rocket to space. Unlike airplanes, a 
			rocket's thrust actually increases with altitude; Falcon 
			9 generates more than 1.7 million pounds of thrust at sea 
			level but gets up to over 1.8 million pounds of thrust in 
			the vacuum of space. The first stage engines are gradually
			throttled near the end of first-stage flight to limit launch vehicle
			acceleration as the rocket’s mass decreases with the 
			burning of fuel.

			<h2>SECOND STAGE</h2>
		
			<p>The second stage, powered by a 
single Merlin vacuum engine, delivers Falcon 9’s payload to the desired orbit. The second stage engine ignites a few seconds after stage separation, and can be restarted multiple times to place multiple payloads into different orbits. For maximum reliability, the second stage has redundant igniter systems. Like the first stage, the second stage is made from a high-strength aluminum-lithium alloy.

			<h3>Nine merlin engines</h3>
			<p>With its nine first-stage Merlin engines clustered together, Falcon 9 can sustain up to two engine shutdowns during flight and still successfully complete its mission. Falcon 9 is the 
			only launch vehicle in its class with this key reliability feature
