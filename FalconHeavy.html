		<div class="container">
			<div class="box1">
			<p>When Falcon Heavy lifts off in 2017, it will be the most powerful operational rocket in
			the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit over 54 metric tons (119,000 lb)--
			a mass equivalent to a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload
			of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost. Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and
			reliability of Falcon 9.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box1">
			<p>
			Its first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27
			Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately
			eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit.
			Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to
			carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars.

			<h1>PAYLOAD</h1>
			<p>Falcon Heavy missions will deliver large payloads to orbit
			inside a composite fairing, but the rocket can also carry the Dragon spacecraft.</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br>
			<h1>SECOND STAGE</h1>

			<p>Falcon Heavy draws upon Falcon 9’s proven design, which minimizes stage
			separation events and maximizes reliability. The second-stage Merlin engine,
			identical to its counterpart on Falcon 9, delivers the rocket’s payload to orbit
			after the main engines cut off and the first-stage cores separate. The engine
			can be restarted multiple times to place payloads into a variety of
			orbits including low Earth, geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) and  geosynchronous orbit (GSO).</p>

			<h1>FIRST STAGE</h1>
			<p>Three cores make up the first stage of Falcon Heavy. The side cores, or boosters,
			are connected  at the base and at the top of the center core’s liquid oxygen tank.
			The three cores, with a total of 27 Merlin engines, generate 22,819 kilonewtons
			(5.13 million pounds) of thrust at liftoff. Shortly after liftoff the center core
			engines are throttled
			down. After the side cores separate, the center core engines throttle back up to full thrust.

			<h2>BOOSTERS</h2>
			<p id="gri">Each of Falcon Heavy’s side cores, or boosters, is equivalent to the
			first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket with nine Merlin engines. At liftoff,
			the boosters and the center core all operate at full thrust. Shortly after
			liftoff, the center core engines are throttled down.
			After the side cores separate, the center core engines throttle back up.
			</p>
			<h2>THREE NINE-ENGINE CORES</h2>
			<p id="gri">Inside each of Falcon Heavy’s three cores is a cluster of nine
			Merlin engines.  These same engines power Falcon 9, enabling
			efficiencies that make Falcon Heavy the most cost-effective heavy-lift
			launch vehicle in the world. With a total of 27 first-stage engines, Falcon
			Heavy has engine-out capability that no other launch vehicle can match—under
			most payload scenarios, it can sustain more than one unplanned engine shutdown
			at any point in
			flight and still successfully complete its mission.</p>
